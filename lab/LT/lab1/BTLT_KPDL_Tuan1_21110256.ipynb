    "- **Data Collection:** This involves gathering data from various sources. In this question, it includes conducting surveys and uploading the collecteds data to a database. So, the correct answer is **(a) Conducting serveys and uploading to database.**\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing:** This involves cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. Correcting missing intries falls under data preprocessing, ass it is a step to ensure the data is accurate and complete before analysis. So, the correct answer is **(b) Correcting missing entries.**\n",
    "- **Data Analysis:** This involves apply algorithms and techniques to extract insights or make predictions from the data. Designing a recommendation algorithm is part of data analysis, as iot involves creating a model to make recommendations based on the collected and preprocessed data. So, the correct answer is **(c) Designing a recommendation algorithm.**"

    "2. The data type of each attribute can vary depending on how the data is represented and used in the context of analysis.\n",
    "- **(a) Age:** Integer or numerical data type. Age is typically represented as a whole number.\n",
    "- **(b) Salary:** Floating-point or numberical data type. Salary can have decimal values and is usually represented as a number.\n",
    "- **(c) ZIP code:** Categorical or nominal data type. ZIP codes are typically represented as integers, but they are categorial in nature and do not have numerical significance beyond identification.\n",
    "- **(d) State of residence:** Categorical or nominal data type. State of categorial variables and are usually represented as string or codes.\n",
    "- **(e) Height:** Floating-point or numerical data type. Height can have decimal values and is typically represented as a number.\n",

    "3. Based on the question provided:\n",
    "- **(a) Original Data:** The original data obtained from the physician's medical notes is likely to be unstructured text data, as it consists of free-form notes written by the physician. Unstructured text data does not fit neatly into rows and columns like structured data does.\n",
    "- **(b) Transformed Data:** The transformed data is in the form of a table containing the medicines prescribed for each patient. This data is likely to be structured data, where each row represents a patient and each column represents a variable (such as patient ID, medicine prescribed, dosage, etc.). The medicines prescribed would likely be categorical data.\n",
    "- **(c) Processing to Transform Data:** The processing of transforming the unstructured text data into a structured table format is called *text mining or text preprocessing*. This involves techniques such as text parsing, extracting relevant information, and organizing it into a structured format suitable for analysis. In this case, specifically, the transformation process involves extracting the medicines prescribed from the medical notes and organizing them into a table format."
