    "Let's denote the Mahalanobis distance between two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as \\( D_M(x, y) \\). It is defined as:\n",
    "\\[ D_M(x, y) = \\sqrt{(x - y)^T \\Sigma^{-1} (x - y)} \\]\n",

    "Now, let's perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the data to get the principal components \\( v_1, v_2, ..., v_n \\) and the corresponding standard deviations \\( \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, ..., \\sigma_n \\). Then, the transformed data points \\( x' \\) and \\( y' \\) can be obtained by projecting the original data points onto these principal components and dividing by the standard deviation of each component.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, \\( (x' - y') \\) is simply the difference between the transformed points \\( x' \\) and \\( y' \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, \\( (x' - y')^T \\Sigma'^{-1} (x' - y') \\) is the sum of squares of the components of \\( (x' - y') \\) weighted by \\( \\sigma_i^2 \\), which is precisely the Euclidean distance between \\( x' \\) and \\( y' \\).\n",
